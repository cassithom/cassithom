(Scene: Penelope's home, a small village in ancient Greece. The stage is set with a table and chairs.)

Act 1:

(Scene 1: Penelope and Eleni are playing near the village square.)

Penelope: (excitedly) Eleni, look what I found! It's a beautiful necklace!

Eleni: (amazed) Oh, Penelope, it's so shiny! Where did you find it?

Penelope: I discovered it near the temple of Athena. I think it belongs to her!

(Scene 2: Penelope and Eleni decide to return the necklace to the temple.)

Act 2:

(Scene 1: Penelope and Eleni arrive at the temple of Athena.)

Penelope: (gently placing the necklace on the altar) Great Athena, we found this necklace and believe it is yours.

Athena: (appearing in a vision) Thank you, young girls. That necklace is indeed mine. You have shown great honor and kindness.

Eleni: (whispering to Penelope) Did you see that? Athena herself!

(Scene 2: Penelope and Eleni return home, feeling proud of their good deed.)

Act 3:

(Scene 1: Penelope's home, nighttime.)

Penelope: (trying to sleep, but troubled) Eleni, I can't stop thinking about the necklace. I miss it.

Eleni: (concerned) Penelope, you did the right thing. Remember, it was Athena's.

(Scene 2: Hermes appears, ready to cause mischief.)

Hermes: (whispering in Penelope's ear) Penelope, if you want the necklace back, all you have to do is take it.

Act 4:

(Scene 1: Penelope's home, morning.)

Penelope: (hesitant and conflicted) Eleni, I dreamt of the necklace again. I want it back.

Eleni: (worried) Penelope, that's not a good idea. You might upset Athena.

(Scene 2: Penelope decides to take the necklace back from the temple.)

Act 5:

(Scene 1: The temple of Athena, Penelope enters nervously.)

Penelope: (taking the necklace) I'm sorry, Athena, but I miss it so much.

(Scene 2: Zeus and Demeter observe Penelope's actions.)

Zeus: (displeased) Penelope has taken something that isn't hers. She must face the consequences.

Demeter: (worried) Let us hope she realizes her mistake and returns it soon.

Act 6:

(Scene 1: Penelope's home, Penelope tries to wear the necklace.)

Penelope: (struggling to put on the necklace) Why won't it fit? It's choking me!

(Scene 2: Athena appears.)

Athena: (disappointed) Penelope, you have stolen from me. The necklace was never meant for you.

Penelope: (crying) I'm sorry, Athena. I was foolish. Please forgive me.

Athena: (softening) Learn from your mistake, Penelope.
